# CMPG323 Project One Master 

## Welcome üñ•Ô∏è 
This is a Open Source Portfolio CV Website designed by and for myself
(Pieter van Zyl)

Created using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10 and Typescript
It is deployed to the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com) (Continous Integration, using pipelines & DevOps)
To display my proficiency in creating a JAM stack.
Furthermore to avoid exposing API Keys in the frontend an Azure Function will be utilized for API calls to twitter and CORE, to proxy my requests and attach the API key.

A live example of this site can be found on: https://pietervanzyl.z1.web.core.windows.net/

This site was a project given to me by university but I am still updating it constantly, trying to get it to look and feel even better as I have more free time.

## Development server

1. Run `npm install` 
2. Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
