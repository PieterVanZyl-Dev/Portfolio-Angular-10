# CMPG323 Project One Master 

## Welcome üñ•Ô∏è 
This is a Open Source Portfolio CV Website designed by and for myself
(Pieter van Zyl)

Designed using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10 and Typescript
It will be deployed to the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com) (Continous Integration, using pipelines (devops))
To display my proficiency in creating a JAM stack.
Furthermore to avoid exposing API Keys in the frontend an Azure Function will be utilized for API calls to twitter and CORE, to proxy my requests and attach the API key.

*The use of Bootstrap is not allowed. Bulma is similar to bootstrap as such I assume Bulma, usage would not be allowed and I will instead implement this with scss, and native angular technology.

A live example of this site can be found on: https://pietervanzyl.z1.web.core.windows.net/
