# CMPG323 Project One Master 

## Welcome üñ•Ô∏è 
This is a Open Source technical CV Website designed for myself
(Pieter van Zyl)

Designed by me using *[Bulma](https://bulma.io) and [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10
It will be deployed to the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com) (Continous Integration, using pipelines (devops))
To display my proficiency in creating a JAM stack.

*The use of Bootstrap is not allowed. Bulma is similar to bootstrap as such I assume Bulma, usage would not be allowed and I will instead implement this with scss, and native angular technology.

A live example of this site can be found on: https://pietervanzyl.z1.web.core.windows.net/


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
