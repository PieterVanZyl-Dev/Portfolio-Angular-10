# CMPG323 Project One Master 

This is a Open Source technical CV Website designed for myself
(Pieter van Zyl)

Designed by me using *[Bulma](https://bulma.io) and [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10
It will be deployed to the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com)
To display my proficiency in creating a JAM stack.

*The use of Bootstrap is not allowed. Bulma is similar to bootstrap as such I assume Bulma, usage would not be allowed and I will instead implement this with scss, and later of the project has been completed and marked add bulma again, possibly as two different versions of the site to show case bulma vs plain css.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
